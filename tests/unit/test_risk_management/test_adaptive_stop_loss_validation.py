"""
Comprehensive Stop-Loss Validation Tests for Adaptive Risk Management.

This module tests stop-loss placement, validation, and triggering logic
in the AdaptiveRiskManager to ensure stop-losses are placed correctly
relative to bid/ask spreads and market conditions to prevent slippage losses.

CRITICAL AREAS TESTED:
1. Stop-loss placement accuracy relative to entry price
2. Bid/ask spread consideration in stop-loss placement
3. Market regime adaptation of stop-loss levels
4. Stop-loss validation against market microstructure
5. Extreme market condition handling
6. Stop-loss triggering logic and slippage prevention
