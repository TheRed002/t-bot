# Claude Code Project Configuration - T-Bot Trading System

## Project Overview
T-Bot is a cryptocurrency trading bot with multiple exchange integrations, risk management, and automated trading strategies.

## Environment Setup
- **Python Version**: 3.10.12
- **Virtual Environment**: WSL Ubuntu at `~/.venv/bin/activate`
- **Working Directory**: `/mnt/e/Work/P-41 Trading/code/t-bot`

## Critical Commands
These commands should be run automatically when making code changes:

### Linting & Formatting
```bash
wsl -e bash -c "cd '/mnt/e/Work/P-41 Trading/code/t-bot' && source ~/.venv/bin/activate && ruff check src/ --fix"
wsl -e bash -c "cd '/mnt/e/Work/P-41 Trading/code/t-bot' && source ~/.venv/bin/activate && ruff format src/"
wsl -e bash -c "cd '/mnt/e/Work/P-41 Trading/code/t-bot' && source ~/.venv/bin/activate && black src/ --line-length 100"
```

### Type Checking
```bash
wsl -e bash -c "cd '/mnt/e/Work/P-41 Trading/code/t-bot' && source ~/.venv/bin/activate && mypy src/ --ignore-missing-imports"
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
wsl -e bash -c "cd '/mnt/e/Work/P-41 Trading/code/t-bot' && source ~/.venv/bin/activate && pytest tests/ -v"

# Run with coverage
wsl -e bash -c "cd '/mnt/e/Work/P-41 Trading/code/t-bot' && source ~/.venv/bin/activate && pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html --cov-report=term"

# Run specific test categories
wsl -e bash -c "cd '/mnt/e/Work/P-41 Trading/code/t-bot' && source ~/.venv/bin/activate && pytest tests/unit/ -v"
wsl -e bash -c "cd '/mnt/e/Work/P-41 Trading/code/t-bot' && source ~/.venv/bin/activate && pytest tests/integration/ -v"
```

## Code Quality Agents

### 1. Formatting Agent
**Purpose**: Automatically format code according to project standards
**Batch Processing**: Process multiple files in parallel
```bash
# Format all Python files in batches
find src/ -name "*.py" | xargs -P 4 -n 10 bash -c 'for file; do ruff format "$file"; done' _
```

### 2. Logical Error Detection Agent
**Purpose**: Detect logical inconsistencies, race conditions, and architectural issues
**Focus Areas**:
- Async/await consistency
- Resource management (connections, locks)
- Error handling completeness
- State management in trading logic

### 3. Test Coverage Agent
**Purpose**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage
**Metrics**:
- Line coverage > 80%
- Branch coverage > 70%
- Critical paths 100% covered (trading operations, risk management)

### 4. Calculation Accuracy Agent
**Purpose**: Verify numerical calculations in trading logic
**Critical Areas**:
- Price calculations
- Position sizing
- Risk metrics
- Portfolio value calculations
- Fee calculations

### 5. Code Duplication Agent
**Purpose**: Identify and refactor duplicate code
**Tools**:
```bash
wsl -e bash -c "cd '/mnt/e/Work/P-41 Trading/code/t-bot' && source ~/.venv/bin/activate && pylint src/ --disable=all --enable=duplicate-code"
```

## Batch Processing Strategy

### Cost-Effective Analysis Pipeline
1. **File Grouping**: Process files by module to maintain context
2. **Parallel Execution**: Run independent checks simultaneously
3. **Incremental Processing**: Only analyze changed files
4. **Cache Results**: Store analysis results to avoid re-processing

### Priority Levels
- **P0 (Critical)**: Trading logic, order execution, risk management
- **P1 (High)**: Exchange connections, data processing, error handling
- **P2 (Medium)**: Strategies, indicators, utilities
- **P3 (Low)**: Documentation, tests, configuration

## Automated Workflow

### Pre-Commit Checks
```bash
# Run all quality checks before committing
wsl -e bash -c "cd '/mnt/e/Work/P-41 Trading/code/t-bot' && source ~/.venv/bin/activate && ./scripts/pre-commit-checks.sh"
```

### Continuous Monitoring
```bash
# Watch for file changes and run appropriate checks
wsl -e bash -c "cd '/mnt/e/Work/P-41 Trading/code/t-bot' && source ~/.venv/bin/activate && ./scripts/watch-and-check.sh"
```

## Module Dependencies
- **P-001**: Core types, exceptions, config
- **P-002A**: Error handling components
- **P-007**: Advanced rate limiting
- **P-007A**: Utility functions

## Security Considerations
- Never log sensitive data (API keys, secrets)
- Validate all external inputs
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Implement rate limiting for all exchange APIs
- Secure WebSocket connections with proper authentication

## Performance Guidelines
- Use async/await for I/O operations
- Implement connection pooling
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Use batch operations for database writes
- Monitor memory usage in long-running processes

## Trading-Specific Validations
- Order price must be within market bounds
- Position size must respect account limits
- Stop-loss must be set for all positions
- Risk per trade must not exceed configured percentage
- Total exposure must stay within portfolio limits


Current task:
I have pasted scripts/setup/. I created these in another project to setup external libs. Currently, when I run pip install, I face talib errors. So I thought we can maybe automate that process in some make setup command so that everything is installed via scripts. Please use setup scripts to install external deps. Also make sure that we are using gpu enabled code and libraries. Make sure we are using gpu enabled libs inside the code throughout to leverage gpu (4090) to speed up everything. Make the whole code base performant. 
Fix all tests, all tests should pass
clean up the code, remove extra files
Use makefile for all project related stuff, we should never call any script directly
move docker-compose files to docker directory.
use configs from .env everywhere in project including docker compose files
Dockerfile should be based on some python ml/ai image which has cuda support. We have cuda installed, make sure you install the relavant version of libs.
Audit of complete system to make sure all configurations are correct, no hard coded values, no code duplications, no import errors, no logical errors, no syntax errors, no calculation errors. 
Make sure the docker compose build command successfully builds the image
Make sure running project va make actually runs all the servers required.
Once everything is sorted out and working, lets clean up the code again and then commit the code to bitbucket.
